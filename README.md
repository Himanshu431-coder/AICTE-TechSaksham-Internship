# AI Based Fitness Calorie Tracker Using Python (AICTE Internship Project)


# AI-Based Fitness Calorie Tracker

## Project Overview
The **AI-Based Fitness Calorie Tracker using Python** is an innovative application developed as part of my internship submission for the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). This project leverages artificial intelligence to assist users in tracking their calorie intake based on their fitness activity data. By employing advanced machine learning models, the application aims to provide accurate predictions of calories burned during various physical activities.

## Key Features
- **Calorie Prediction**: Utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict calorie expenditure based on user-input fitness activity data.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Developed using Streamlit, this feature allows users to seamlessly input their fitness data and receive real-time predictions regarding calories burned.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing critical data trends, enhancing users' understanding of their calorie consumption and exercise performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit  
- **Data Manipulation Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Techniques

- **Linear Regression**: Implemented to predict continuous values such as calories burned based on user activity.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Employed to enhance prediction accuracy through the aggregation of multiple decision trees.
- **Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV)**: Utilized for optimizing hyperparameters, thereby improving overall model performance.
- **XGBoost Regressor (XGBRegressor)**: A powerful gradient boosting model that builds an ensemble of trees sequentially to improve predictions, offering high accuracy and handling missing data effectively.

- # üí° Need of the model:

There are many apps that track the amount of calories you consume, but few that calculate the number of calories burned during a workout. This model can be developed as a standalone app to calculate calories burned, or it can be integrated into existing apps, such as HealthifyMe, to provide users with a comprehensive view of both the calories consumed and the calories burned throughout the day. This would give users a complete insight into their diet and overall health.

### üìö About the dataset:

the csv has 4 datasets exercise, calories, workout and workout_logs

### üìï exercise dataset:-

this csv contains all the info on the person's workout (has our independet features)

| #   | Column     | Non-Null Count | Dtype   |
|:---: | :------: | :--------------: | :-----: |
| 0   | User_ID    | 15000 non-null | int64   |
| 1   | Gender     | 15000 non-null | object  |
| 2   | Age        | 15000 non-null | int64   |
| 3   | Height     | 15000 non-null | float64 |
| 4   | Weight     | 15000 non-null | float64 |
| 5   | Duration   | 15000 non-null | float64 |
| 6   | Heart_Rate | 15000 non-null | float64 |
| 7   | Body_Temp  | 15000 non-null | float64 |

the Column are self-Exploratory

### üìó calories dataset:-

this csv contains calories burned by all workouts in exercise (has our target value / dependent feature "calories")

| #   | Column    | Non-Null Count  | Dtype    | 
| :---:  | :------: | :--------------: | :-----: | 
| 0   | User_ID   | 15000 non-null  | int64    |
| 1   | Calories  | 15000 non-null  | float64  |

1. User_ID: unique id for each person
2. Calories: the the total calories they burned during their workout

### üìô workout:-

* this is our main csv, this is a combination of all Columns from
exercise (features) and calories burned in each workout (target)

* both calorie_exercise_workout_model_analysis.ipynb and main.pyw
use this csv for training their models


| #  |  Column     |  Non-Null Count | Dtype   |
|:---: |  :------: |  :--------------: | :-----: |
| 0  |  User_ID    |  15000 non-null | int64   |
| 1  |  Gender     |  15000 non-null | object  |
| 2  |  Age        |  15000 non-null | int64   |
| 3  |  Height     |  15000 non-null | float64 |
| 4  |  Weight     |  15000 non-null | float64 |
| 5  |  Duration   |  15000 non-null | float64 |
| 6  |  Heart_Rate |  15000 non-null | float64 |
| 7  |  Body_Temp  |  15000 non-null | float64 |
| 8  |  Calories   |  15000 non-null | float64 |

this is a combination of exercise and calories csv

### üìì workout_logs:-

* this csv just saves the workout info with calories burnt for the purpose of keeping track and logging

# üñãÔ∏è Insights

### 1. ratio of male to female

the ratio of male to female is almost equal, but the number of females is a little bit more

### 2. Age range of people
